## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, And JavaScript

This website was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to understand the flexibility and usage of different elements in conjunction with responsive design. I really used this project as a ease in to truly understand conecepts like the box model and responsive design.


## Growth:

Through building this project I was able to grasp basic fundamental concepts that are often overlooked. I wanted to truly understand the reason behind things like responsive design and the box model before moving forward to more difficult and challenging concepts.
